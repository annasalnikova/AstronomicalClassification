Insights into the correlations between the data
As far as class 92 is concerned, the small sample based on the light flux over different observation times (mjd) shows that the variable "detected" always has the value 0 when the light flux of the object was between -100 and 100. On the graph it appears to be close to zero.
For class 88, the number of objects for which the variable "detected" has the value 0 seems to be significantly higher.
